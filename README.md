My version of the kaban project of http://survivejs.com/

This can be used as a nice start point for:

* webpack configuration with support for hot module replacement (Dev) and product builds
* babel with es6 + jsx support
* eslint
* a complete react app with alt.js as a flux replacement
* various other enchancements (check package.js and webpack.config.js)
